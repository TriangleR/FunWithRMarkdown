# How can I do this?

### Literate programming  

Incorporate text (including markup) with computer instructions and the output from computer instructions.

> "The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of style."  
>    - Donald Knuth

Within the R world, this began with Sweave. 

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming
- http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf

# Sweave

- Incorporates or "weaves" R commands into a LateX document. 
- Pretty old (first appeared in 2002)
- Only supports R as a programming language
- Only supports LateX for markup
- https://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/
- .Rnw -> R "noweb" http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/


# Sweave - how does it work?

- Write a markup document, just as you always would
- Include R code in "chunks"

```    
This is some LateX text.
\begin{RidiculousMarkup}

<<echo = FALSE, fig = TRUE>>=
# This is an R code chunk.

dfAwesomeData <- data.frame(x = someVariable, y = someOtherVariable)

plt <- ggplot(dfAwesomeData, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_line()
plt
@

And now we're back to LateX.
\end{AbsurdCommands}
```

# Comments

- Sweave just produces TEX output. You still need an engine to render the final .PDF
- MikTeX (http://miktex.org/) works fine for me
- Probably sufficient if you're an academic

For most people (or at least Yihui Xie), Sweave wasn't enough. More output formats, more input languages, hooks, etc.

Enter knitr.

# knitr

- Same basic concept as Sweave
- Multi-language engine
- Multiple processing options
    - knitr
    - Rhtml-
    - brew
    - Others (Rrst, Rtex, Rasciidoc)
- http://yihui.name/knitr/
- cheat sheet - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/vignettes/knitr-refcard.pdf

# knitr

Code chunks look a little different.

- We must specify the language engine
- Code chunks may use R expressions, i.e. we may conditionally execute

<!-- https://ramnathv.github.io/posts/verbatim-chunks-knitr/ -->

```{r cache = F, echo = FALSE}
knitr::knit_hooks$set(source = function(x, options){
  if (!is.null(options$verbatim) && options$verbatim){
    opts = gsub(",\\s*verbatim\\s*=\\s*TRUE\\s*", "", options$params.src)
    bef = sprintf('\n\n    ```{r %s}\n', opts, "\n")
    stringr::str_c(
      bef, 
      knitr:::indent_block(paste(x, collapse = '\n'), "    "), 
      "\n    ```\n"
    )
  } else {
    stringr::str_c("\n\n```", tolower(options$engine), "\n", 
      paste(x, collapse = '\n'), "\n```\n\n"
    )
  }
})
```

```{r echo = TRUE, verbatim = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
data(movies)
m <- ggplot(movies, aes(x = rating)) + geom_density()
m
```


# Quick demo

Example_Markdown.Rmd

# knitr hooks

`knitr` supports user-defined pre- and post-processing of code chunks. In fact, I used one two slides ago, obtained from https://ramnathv.github.io/posts/verbatim-chunks-knitr/

```{r echo = TRUE, verbatim = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
knitr::knit_hooks$set(source = function(x, options){
  if (!is.null(options$verbatim) && options$verbatim){
    opts = gsub(",\\s*verbatim\\s*=\\s*TRUE\\s*", "", options$params.src)
    bef = sprintf('\n\n    ```{r %s}\n', opts, "\n")
    stringr::str_c(
      bef, 
      knitr:::indent_block(paste(x, collapse = '\n'), "    "), 
      "\n    ```\n"
    )
  } else {
    stringr::str_c("\n\n```", tolower(options$engine), "\n", 
      paste(x, collapse = '\n'), "\n```\n\n"
    )
  }
})
```

# knitr options

Very similar to a hook, you can set an upload function within the package options. This works fairly well with the `RWordpress` package.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE, verbatin = TRUE}
opts_knit$set(upload.fun = WrapWordpressUpload, base.url = NULL)

WrapWordpressUpload = function(file) {
  result = RWordpress::uploadFile(file)
  result$url
}

options(WordPressLogin = c(PirateGrunt = "myPassword")
        , WordPressURL = "http://PirateGrunt.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php")

RWordpress::knit2wp("MyCoolPost.Rmd"
                    , title = "Catchy title"
                    , publish = FALSE
                    , shortcode = TRUE
                    , categories = c("R"))
```

RWordpress hasn't been updated in a while. Written by Duncan Temple Lang, so nice pedigree, but could be out of date.

# knitr + Markdown = R markdown

- Unifies multiple output formats by having content written in markdown, rather than a specific markup language
- Once the markdown output is generated use `pandoc` to render in other markup languages
- Comes for free with RStudio

# Markdown

> "A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions." – John Gruber

- Very simple syntax
- Human readable
- May be converted into other formats
- Read about the life of Aaron Swartz
- http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

# Pandoc

- Haskell tool written by John MacFarlane
- Recognizes that most markup languages have common features: level 1-n text, hyperlinks, tables, images
- MS Word uses XML -> that's another markup language!

http://pandoc.org/

--- 

First we mark down, then we mark up

Got it? Good.

> - Also, YAML.

# YAML

YAML = "**Y**AML **A**in't **M**arkup **L**anguage"

> "What It Is: YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages."

# R markdown from the command line

```
render(input, output_format = NULL, output_file = NULL, output_dir = NULL,
       output_options = NULL, intermediates_dir = NULL,
       runtime = c("auto", "static", "shiny"),
       clean = TRUE, params = NULL, envir = parent.frame(), 
       quiet = FALSE, encoding = getOption("encoding"))
```

```
rmarkdown::render(myFile, output)
```

# HTML

- CSS
- Build your own website
- Nothing stopping you from using JavaScript libraries like Bootstrap and D3.
- If you're targeting HTML, you can use HTML within the R markdown document itself
    - If you do, you'll need to write or copy a fair bit of HTML, css and java script 
- Blog like a boss

# Basic site demo

# Other stuff

- Tables
- Customized reporting with `whisker`
- Jekyll
- Jupyter
- Creating your own templates

# Tables

- [xtable] (http://xtable.r-forge.r-project.org/)
- knitr::kable 
- [pander] (http://rapporter.github.io/pander/)
- [DT] (https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)

# Table data

```{r }
data(Master, package = "Lahman")
Master <- head(Master[, 1:5], 5)
```

# xtable

```{r echo = TRUE, results = 'asis'}
library(xtable)
print(xtable(Master), type = 'html')
```

# kable

```{r echo=TRUE, results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(Master)
```

# pander

```{r results = 'asis', echo=TRUE}
pander::pandoc.table(Master)
```

# DT

```{r }
DT::datatable(Master)
```

# Tables

Of these options, I tend to use `pander` most often.

- Possible to allow the table to break across pages
- Easy to control where breaks happen
- Easy to align columns

DT is super awesome for easy data search. Loads of bells and whistles on the package site: https://rstudio.github.io/DT/.

Note that this discussion of tables has _nothing_ to do with neat tabular output from functions like `lm`. For that, check out [`stargazer`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/index.html)

# `whisker` and moustache templates

- Uses the [`whisker`](https://github.com/edwindj/whisker) package
- Wrap merge fields in triple braces
- Pass merge values in with a named list

This is not the same thing as a "parameterized report" described here: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_parameterized_reports.html

# Moustache example

<!--
Why am I not evaluating this code chunk? Because, rendering a markdown file from within a markdown file, causes an error:
'Error in env$metadata <- list() : 
  cannot change value of locked binding for 'metadata''
  
See this issue: https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/248
-->

```{r MoustacheExample, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(whisker)
data <- list(Hitter1 = "Sammy Sosa"
             , Hitter2 = "Pete Rose"
             , NameId1 = "sosasa01"
             , NameId2 = "rosepe01")

outFile <- whisker.render(readLines("Example_Whisker.Rmd"), data)
writeLines(outFile, "SosaVsRose.Rmd")
rmarkdown::render("SosaVsRose.Rmd", envir = new.env(), runtime = "static", quiet = TRUE)
```

# Jekyll

- http://jekyllrb.com/
- Converts markdown into static HTML
- Great for blogging and simple page design
- Default engine for GitHub pages
- Liquid templating system
- With effort, we can use moustache templating in R
- See also: StaticDocs - https://github.com/hadley/staticdocs

# 

The rendering could probably be done in a makefile. 

```
$ Rscript rmarkdown::render(inFile, markdown)
$ jekyll serve
```

# Jekyll demo

# Jupyter

- Saves the commands and output of an interactive session
- Formerly IPython
- Support for over 50 language kernels
- You'll need python
- Then get install instructions here: http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html
- And the R kernel http://irkernel.github.io/installation/ (They've clearly not heard of devtools)

>- I couldn't get it to work locally

# Customized templates

- Possible to roll your own template
- Pandoc template:
    - Uses a templating framework wherein field delimited by `$` are replaced with YAML metadata, or command-line arguments
    - http://pandoc.org/demo/example9/templates.html
- RStudio will recognize "skeletons" in the dialog box for a new RMarkdown document
- http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_document_templates.html

# Some cool pre-made templates

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/rticles")
devtools::install_github("jjallaire/revealjs")
```

- [Tufte template](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html)
- [Reveal.js](https://github.com/jjallaire/revealjs)

# Stuff I didn't talk about

  - Slidify
      - http://slidify.org/
      - Watch this space! Ramnath Vaidyanathan is pretty tremendous.
  - Shiny Docs
      - They're awesome, but require a big detour into Shiny, which is a talk unto itself.
